# zfs-backup
Set of scripts I use for my zfs backups

You have the option to online/offline your backup pool.
This would prevent any corruption from reaching your backup pool when not doing a backup

UPDATE:202050601 - changed snapshot naming to allow for hourly snapshots

Note : if you have ZFS, I hope you thought of using a mirror or a raidzX otherwise why use it :-)
